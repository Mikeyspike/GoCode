	1.4: Once installed, open the application.

2 - Usage:
-----------------------
When GoCode first starts the editor will load. This will open up a blank document, ready for you to type in.

	Main Menu:
	------------
	Once the app has fully loaded, touch the hamburger menu icon, which is at the top left of the screen, on the
	navigation bar.
	You may also swipe right from the left on the screen to open the navigation bar.
	In order to close the navigation bar, either touch outside of the navigation bar, or swipe left from the right
	side of the navigation menu.

	The Bottom Bar:
	------------
	The bottom bar situated at the bottom of the editor has 3 seperate buttons which open up different features of 
	GoCode.

		Search:
		------
		Searching the current document is as simple as pressing the search icon, and typing in the term into the field
		that pops up at the bottom of the screen. Once the search term has been entered, press the tick button on your
		keyboard to run the search. All items in the document that match the term will be highlighted.

		Replace:
		------
		Replacing words or phrases is as simple as searching for them. Press the replace icon (found in the middle of
		the bottom bar) and enter in the term you wish to replace in the box. once you have entered the term you wish
		to replace, the box will change to allow you to enter what you wish to replace it with. When this information 
		has been entered, the app will run through each found phrase and ask if you wish to replace this instance, 
		or stop completely.

		Templates:
		------
		Templates can either be added into the current document at the current cursor position, or created as a new file.
		Touch the templates icon (far right icon) to bring up the templates dialog. This dialog will include a dropdown
		menu which will allow you to select the template to use.
		Below are buttons which allow you to either add the template, or start as a new file. Starting as a new file
		will wipe the current document.

	New File:
	------------
	To create a new file, open the navigation menu and press the "New File" Button. This will alert you that it will
	wipe the current document. Pressing yes will clear the current editor's text.

	Open File:
	------------
	To open a file, open the navigation menu and press the "Open File" Button. This will bring up a modal window which
	will alert you it will clear the current document. It also shows a file input which is used to open the devices
	native file browser. The file browser is set to only see files that have the extentions:
		.txt
		.html
		.php
		.css
		.js
	This is due to GoCode being specific to web development for the current time.

	Save File:
	------------
	To save the current document, open the navigation menu and press "Save File". This will show a modal window which
	will alert you any files will be overwritten. It also includes two text inputs, one for the directory to save to
	and another for the file name. Currently, only the file name input will make any changes.

	App Settings:
	------------
	To open the App Settings, open the navigation menu and press the "App Settings" Button. This will open a window
	that will allow you to change the theme of the editor (Defaults to Monokai), The syntax highlighting type 
	(defaults to HTML), and finally the font size of the editor (defaults to 16px.)

	About App:
	------------
	To open the About app window, open the navigation menu and press the "About App" button. This window will display
	a small ammount of information regarding the App and what it was built with.
